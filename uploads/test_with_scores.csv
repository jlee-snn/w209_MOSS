[This was crossposted to a zillion groups.  I don't intend to
carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt.sex, particularly
one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument.  However
I thought readers might be interested to know about the
discussion there.  --clh]

I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an
immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it.  I intend to
show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this
statement.  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be 
made without there being a religious justification for morality,
in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist.

Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side,
i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral,
or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do
so.  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have
a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.

This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and
expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where
their ideas are standing.  As I'm not sure what groups would be interested
in this discussion, I will be posting an announcement of it to several,
and if someone thinks of appropriate groups, let me know.

If someone on here doesn't receive alt.sex, let me know and I'll make
an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically
distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as I'll
use that as the main forum for this.  By ""exception to usual policy"" is
that I normally charge for this, but for the duration the service will be
available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on Internet
or Bitnet.

I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger
audience on usenet / internet than on the smaller BBS networks.

To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger, this will 
begin on Monday, May 24, to give people who want to make the response
time to identify themselves.  Anonymous postings are acceptable, since
some people may not wish to identify themselves.  Also, if someone else
wants to get in on my side, they are free to do so.  

This should be *much* more interesting than Abortion debates!

There are exactly ZERO verses that ""clearly"" address the issues.

The kind of interpretation I see as ""incredibly perverse"" is that applied
to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander
-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.

The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_
in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by ""fornication"" or ""theft"" or ""coveting"" or
""reviling"" or ""drunkenness"" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all ""clear"" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest
in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,
with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas.

Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I
know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and
child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly
""harmless"" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --
that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]

	""'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything
	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one
	will not let anything make free with me.""  [1 Cor. 6:12]

Which is a restatement that we must have no other ""god"" before God.  A
commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.

I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.
Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of
which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine
them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are ""moral"" and
which ones are ""ritual.""  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ""ritual law"" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.

I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how ""repulsive"" and ""unnatural"" our acts are -- and what
do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating
insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you
say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part
of the ritual law?

For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can
be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to
determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the
whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: ""No doubt I am free to do anything.""
But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,
the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go
through Leviticus and decide each ""command"" there on that basis, then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this
context, it is remarkably offensive to say:

>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in ""defense"" of bestiality.  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human
adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not
mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,
the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to
love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.

Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every
corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never
even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.
WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN
to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?
God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or
condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in
insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are
SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.

Why, for God's sake?

	""For God did not send the Son into the world
	to condemn the world,
	but that the world might be saved through him.
	Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned
	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.
	Now the judgment is this:
	the light has come into the world,
	but men have preferred darkness to light
	because their deeds were evil.
	For everyone who practices wickedness
	hates the light,
	and does not come near the light
	for fear his deeds will be exposed.
	But he who acts in truth
	comes into the light,
	so that it may be sh0own
	that his deeds are done in God.""	John 3:17-21

For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*
show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.

However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;
and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.

	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning
of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn
from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming
scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
drawn from them.

	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic
way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.

	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,
or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It
gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful
questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
in contradiction.
