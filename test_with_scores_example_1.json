I intend to\nshow that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this\nstatement.  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be \nmade without there being a religious justification for morality,\nin fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist.\n\nAnyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side,\ni.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral,\nor that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do\nso.  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have\na rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.\n\nThis should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and\nexpose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where\ntheir ideas are standing.

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\nshow a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.\n-- \nMichael L.
